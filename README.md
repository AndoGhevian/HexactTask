# Hexact Task
First Solution - [https://github.com/AndoGhevian/HexactTask/tree/master](https://github.com/AndoGhevian/HexactTask/tree/master)
## New Solution
In this Solution You will be able to see and interact programatically with progress of traversion.

Here I introduce a **PingPong** utility, which will provide ability to be notified
when a new Link or Url processed.

## Usage
Type `npx https://github.com/AndoGhevian/HexactTask#stream-solution [website-url]`

**website-url** is optional, By default traverse script will look for server on
http://localhost:8000.

Or You can manually select the command:
1. `npx -p https://github.com/AndoGhevian/HexactTask#stream-solution traverse [website-url]`
1. (**Default**)`npx -p https://github.com/AndoGhevian/HexactTask#stream-solution traverse-stream [website-url]`
